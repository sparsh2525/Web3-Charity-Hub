The state of Himachal Pradesh is experiencing a state of turmoil due to severe floods and landslides, resulting in extensive devastation. Thousands of individuals find themselves displaced, stranded, and cut off from assistance. 

Homes have been engulfed by water, lives have been lost, and aspirations have been shattered. The scenes emerging from Himachal Pradesh are undeniably horrifying. Urgent and decisive action is required to address this crisis, and the victims of the floods are in desperate need of immediate relief supplies for that we came up with a small initiative where people can donate the essentials & those who are in need can ask for the same. Create a crowdfunding & awareness website to perform the same with a verification portal through an administrator which verifies the document when you ask for donations/help.

During this challenging time, thousands of people become victims of inhuman crimes like Drug Peddling, Smuggling & several other Cruelties. Join the movement & stand together with us.
